Users will have access to coupons, game recommendations, movies, series, ebooks and other items that can be used online and that are intended to entertain. In addition, there will be an optional questionnaire, with the purpose of getting to know the user better and bringing more relatable recommendations for the user and keeping them distracted. Another purpose will be to collect more information about how people are behaving in quarantine and consequently contribute with more useful information that can help other projects and organizations. * WARNING: * THE DATA COLLECTED WILL HAVE ANONYMOUS CHARACTER, NO PERSON WILL BE EXPOSED.
